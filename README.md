# Getting started

Install the [visual studio code editing software](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

# Kanban board
In order to keep track of progress, report bugs and think about new features we use a project management method called [kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban). Take a look at our [kanban board](https://gitlab.com/project-based-mentor/universe/-/boards) and maybe you'll find something interesting.

# Communication
