# Kanban board
In order to keep track of progress, report bugs and think about new features we use a project management method called [kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban). Take a look at our [kanban board](https://gitlab.com/project-based-mentor/universe/-/boards) and maybe you'll find something interesting.
